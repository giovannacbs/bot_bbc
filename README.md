# **Telegram's Bot - BBC News in Portuguese**

Code available here is to set up a bot that, according to the theme the user enters, gives out the last five news about that section available at https://www.bbc.com/portuguese.

*If you want to fork the repository, just pay attention that you need to create a new enviroment token at Render (in this case) for your bot's token.*
